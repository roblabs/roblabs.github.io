# Intro â€” MAGE on a local macOS server

We spent a few hours testing and getting [MAGE](http://ngageoint.github.io/MAGE/) up and running.  Here are some notes on what it takes to get a *local* server up and running with macOS & iOS.

Our lead use case is field surveys for back country areas such as trails & wilderness areas.

## `mage-server`

The MAGE team has iOS and Android apps in the public app stores, but you first need to stand up a `mage-server`.  We were quite successful following the notes for macOS with `brew` in the [readme](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-server#setup--installation).

This serves off our local macOS at [http://localhost:4242](http://localhost:4242) or [http://10.1.2.3:4242](http://10.1.2.3:4242).  Since we are runnning in a local network, we can get away with http.

There is also a Docker container built [sofwerx/docker-mage-server](https://github.com/sofwerx/docker-mage-server).  If you put the MAGE server out in the public, then you will need to ensure your http**S** certificates are in order.  We have used [https://letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org) for our certificates.

### Custom Settings

* `<mage>/environment/local/env.js` â€” We wanted the media files to be quickly accessible in our macOS Finder window.  We also wanted to test what the `tokenExpiration` values did.
  * You can easily see the `PNG` &  `MP4` media files that went along with our observation trials.  They are also extracted via the Export feature in `mage-server`.

```javascript
environment.userBaseDirectory = '/Users/roblabs/mage/users';
environment.iconBaseDirectory = '/Users/roblabs/mage/icons';
environment.attachmentBaseDirectory = '/Users/roblabs/mage/attachments';

environment.tokenExpiration = 60 * 60 * 24 * 10; // 10 days
```

* `<mage>/config.js` â€” When we initially provisioned our first user, there was no clue to what the password requirements were.... Until we read the source code....  Set accordingly.

```javascript
"authenticationStrategies": {
  "local": {
    "passwordMinLength": 14
  }
```  

## iOS

Our `mage-server` is running local on macOS and without http**S**.  This meant we could not use the [MAGE iOS app in the Apple Appstore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/m-a-g-e/id1032815042).  Until we get this sorted out, thankfully [MAGE for iOS](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-ios) is open source and we make any tweaks we wanted.

* Since we are running on a local macOS, we can save our field surveyors a step, by including the URL to our `mage-server` in the iOS app.

* `MAGE-info.plist` - Apple requires all apps to use http**S**; any that don't must be listed via exception.  See [https://stackoverflow.com/a/30751597](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30751597)
