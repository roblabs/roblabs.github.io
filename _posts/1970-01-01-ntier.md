### 10 Essentials

* Map — Northern Tier recommends not buying maps as your route will not be set until you arrive.  But if you go through Ely Base, you will at least need one of the maps from [W.A. Fisher](
http://www.fishermaps.com/shop/f-10-basswood-lake-fall-lake-moose-lake/).
* Ely Base is on the eastern shore of Moose Lake
