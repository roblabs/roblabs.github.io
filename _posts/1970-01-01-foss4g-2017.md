## FOSS4G Boston

This was ePi Rational's first [FOSS4G](http://2017.foss4g.org/) event.  For 2017, we gave a talk on how we built a visualization platform for [Oceaneos.org](http://Oceaneos.org) based on Ocean Color data from NASA.  We also built an offline map showcasing [OpenMapTiles](http://OpenMapTiles.org) technology packed into an offline mobile map for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/offline-map-for-foss4g-boston/id1265708822?mt=8).
