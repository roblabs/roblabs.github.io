The Indoor Mapping Data Format is Apple's way of modeling how to map indoor spaces.  An IMDF *archive* is one `manifest.json` file with many `.geojson` files which are tightly related to the `id` property in some of the GeoJSON.  
Apple has created an IMDF Sandbox to validate and/or report any issues you may have with your IMDF archive.  

Here is a summary of links that we used to learn development of our IMDF solution.

* Indoor Mapping Data Format — https://register.apple.com/resources/imdf/
* Introducing the Indoor Maps Program - https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/245
  * Video 245  from WWDC 2019 describes the IMDF Sandbox — https://register.apple.com/indoor/imdf-sandbox
  * > Because building and understanding IMDF can be a bit more complicated, there is the IMDF Sandbox, a tool for visualization, archive inspection, editing and experimentation with an IMDF archive.
