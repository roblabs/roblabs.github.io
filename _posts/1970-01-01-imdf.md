The Indoor Mapping Data Format is Apple's way of modeling how to map indoor spaces.  An IMDF *archive* is one `manifest.json` file with many `.geojson` files which are tightly related to the `id` property in some of the GeoJSON.  
Apple has created an IMDF Sandbox to validate and/or report any issues you may have with your IMDF archive.  

Here is a summary of links that we used to learn development of our IMDF solution.

* The [Indoor Mapping Data Format](https://register.apple.com/resources/imdf/) specification from Apple
* The WWDC 2019 video titled [Introducing the Indoor Maps Program](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/245)
  * Video 245 from WWDC 2019 describes the [IMDF Sandbox](https://register.apple.com/indoor/imdf-sandbox)
  * > *Because building and understanding IMDF can be a bit more complicated, there is the IMDF Sandbox, a tool for visualization, archive inspection, editing and experimentation with an IMDF archive.*

* The WWDC 2019 video titled [Adding Indoor Maps to your App and Website](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/241)
  * Video 241 from WWDC 2019 gives sample MapKit & MapKit JS projects
