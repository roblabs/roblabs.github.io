## Map for 59-North.com

* This map incorporates two paths.
* Dashed Yellow — Path of the Isbjorn using the `.gpx` data from Virginia to British Virgin Isles
  * GPS samples are taken every four hours; sailing around islands may appear to jump over land, and will need to be cleaned up
* Solid Yellow - Example route from San Juan, P.R. to BVI, to give potential crew an idea of the route.
