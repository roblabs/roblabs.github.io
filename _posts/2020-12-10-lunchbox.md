## Overview

Maps tell stories about a location – and static maps are the "stock photo" version of a map: a simple snapshot, complete with points and lines that direct the viewer to precise location knowledge.

How a map is distributed and consumed is as important as the cartography elements. A static map for print will need plenty of pixels for proper output. A static map for social media or messaging applications might look best as motionless, or the story could be enhanced with animation. The ultimate use case for a static map is to create an anchor to click through to your web or mobile map.

The Mapbox Static Images API can be used in applications where Javascript or an interactive maps cannot be used.

You’ll learn how to...

* Use [Mapbox Studio](http://studio.mapbox.com/) to export high resolution images of custom map styles.
* Use the [Mapbox Static Images API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#static-images) to create static map images from a URL.
* Use the [Mapbox Static Tiles API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#static-tiles) to pull your Mapbox GL styled map into a print workflow using open source software for Geospatial such QGIS or GeoJSON.io

## Examples

### 1. Static Images with Open Tools

Analysis of communicating the Valley Fire in San Diego County, Sep 2020.

Static maps can be animated to give the proper affect – see The Valley Fire in San Diego County for an example of enabling "*location enlightenment*" to propagate widespread understanding of a piece of spatial information.

Created with Mapbox Styles + [GeoJson.io](https://geojson.io/) for collaboration; text added in post processing. Stock [MAKI icons](https://labs.mapbox.com/maki-icons/), line fill and thickness done using Mapbox [Simple Styling](https://github.com/mapbox/simplestyle-spec/tree/master/1.1.0) in GeoJSON.io (see it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RobChohan/status/1303726967162695680?s=20)).

##### Valley Fire, San Diego County, Sep 8, 2020
* Fire Officials do an amazing job communicating information
* [#ValleyFire](https://twitter.com/CALFIRESANDIEGO/status/1303413734577065984)
  * Centered near [Alpine, California](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-streets-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4M29iazA2Z2gycXA4N2pmbDZmangifQ.-g_vE53SD2WrJ6tFX7QHmA#9.73/32.7748/-116.7286)— eastern San Diego County
* [Road Closures](https://twitter.com/CALFIRESANDIEGO/status/1303721389203976192) announced by CalFire
* A map is as *enlightening* as a photo
* Animation allows for two different basemaps

### 2. Static Images from the Command Line

Image of a baseball field in Solano County, CA, produced using the Mapbox command line interface.  The goal is to tell the story of a location through its metadata or physical dimensions.

* Uses the [`mapbox staticmap` command line interface to Mapbox Web Services](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-cli-py#staticmap)
