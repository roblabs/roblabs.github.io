## Print #mapsForNonProfits

During the summer of 2021, we networked with the [Build Lebanon Trails](https://BuildLebanonTrails.com) association to help them with their map assets as they start to build more trails in [Lebanon, Oregon](https://roblabs.com/97355).

* This is a 2'x3' map that is print ready with dimensions of 7200 × 10800 pixels at 300 pixels per inch.
  * For a web version of this 2'x3' map, see this [link](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/com.roblabs.yellow-dog/tmp/blt/20211101/leaflet-2021.html).  This can be integarated into the Build Lebanon Trails website by downloading this [97 MB Zip file](https://github.com/roblabs/maps-for-non-profits/releases/download/v2021-11-02/BuildLebanonTrails.com-online-map.zip).
  * This [251 MB TIFF](https://github.com/roblabs/maps-for-non-profits/releases/download/v2021-11-02/Build-Lebanon-Trails-2x3.tif) version of the map should only be downloaded if you are interested in printing your own copy of the map.
