## Mapbox Styles
Mapbox delivers smooth, fast maps via vectors.  Their design and architecture allows you to adjust the map, fonts and icons to your style or branding.


### Mapbox Studio

[Mapbox.com/studio](http://Mapbox.com/studio) is a tool to design custom maps.  The maps can fit your color or branding guidelines and are [mobile](https://www.mapbox.com/mobile/) ready when you have your look and feel all set and are ready for iOS and Android.  

[Mapbox Gallery](https://www.mapbox.com/gallery) is a great introduction into the power of what can be done with your own Styling.




### Mapbox GL
Mapbox is built on Open GL.  Basically, built upon technologies that make video games.

From Mapbox's Glossary on GL

_[Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/help/define-mapbox-gl/) is a vector rendering framework for highly customizable and responsive client-side maps. Maps render at a super high framerate and allow for dynamic styling._


### Mapbox Styles out of the box

Mapbox has several Styles that you can start using right away.  See either [Mapbox.com/maps](https://www.mapbox.com/maps/) or the [Styles API](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#Styles) links for details

* [Light & Dark](https://www.mapbox.com/maps/light-dark)
* [Outdoors](https://www.mapbox.com/maps/outdoors)
* [Streets](https://www.mapbox.com/maps/streets/)
* [Satellite](https://www.mapbox.com/maps/satellite/) (Mapbox offers cloudless satellite coverage at certain zoom levels)
