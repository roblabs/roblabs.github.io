## Research

### Secure Data using Firebase

* Google offers a product for a RealTime database built on [NoSQL](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/) with [authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/).
* Any type of data can be stored including latitude, longitude, or any other measured data.  
* An administrative front end could be made to search, and name metadata about objects.
* Algorithms, such as trilateration can be calculated on Geo data, either in the cloud or in the browser

#### Example of Geo data stored in Firebase
  * See this [map](http://codepen.io/roblabs/full/woMyJy) of US Counties.
  * The map is an admin view of US Counties with certain attributes
  * Use case is a customer would input colors and tags for each US county, then data in [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org) format was stored in a Firebase Realtime Database.
  * A mobile user could update a map and in real time a desktop user would have the same information.

#### Firebase + IOT

* Several articles on how Firebase is used in IoT applications
* [Firebase IoT Tutorial](https://rominirani.com/firebase-iot-tutorial-46203a92f869)


### Trilateration

Given at least three circles, with known centers and radii, find the point closest to where they intersect.

Optimal solutions for a trilateration algorithm

* A Javascript algorithm that takes three or more circles
* Javascript is chosen because its portable enough to run in a browser, but if needed it can also be wrapped up into a cloud algorithm.

#### Example

```javascript
p1 = { x: 20, y: 20, z: 0, r: 32 };
p2 = { x: 70, y: 40, z: 0, r: 37 };
p3 = { x: 60, y: 70, z: 0, r: 35 };
```

#### Trilatertion Resources

* Trilatertion in Javascript (no license, sent request to the author) — [gheja/trilateration.js](https://github.com/gheja/trilateration.js).  This is a generalized 3-space with three points of input.  Require a generalized method for 2-space and n-points.

* Would be ideal to have trilateration algorithms in [Turfjs](https://github.com/turfjs/turf-node-example).  That way the algorithm has several more reviewers, and can account for trilateration applications to Geo.
