GeoJSON.io was developed by Mapbox and is "a quick, simple tool for creating, viewing, and sharing spatial data.

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:18.214
It is a perfect way to visualize, test or learn how GeoJSON data is created, formatted, styled or inspected.

00:00:18.214 --> 00:00:23.632
We have made updates to GeoJSON.io with Mapbox styles from the Public Domain.

00:00:23.632 --> 00:00:27.674
Say you want to visualize this GeoJSON from Joshua Tree.

00:00:27.674 --> 00:00:32.417
You can open a version of GeoJSON.io with Public Domain Styles.

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:37.859
Once you have opened the app, then paste your GeoJSON URL by tapping
Meta, New Window.

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.802
This will open a new browser tab with your GeoJSON data.

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:47.428
Then you can use the usual tools such as inspecting geometries or view GeoJSON properties in a table.
