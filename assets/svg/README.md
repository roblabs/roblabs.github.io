The RobLabs.com logo was created with QGIS (epi-maps/logo/logo.qgs)

> *"The logo referenced by a Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) record must be in a specific format. It’s based on the Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) Tiny 1.2 format specified by the W3C, with fewer allowed elements. The version supported by BIMI has been defined as SVG Tiny Portable/Secure (SVG P/S). Given that this is a new format, existing graphic creation and modification tools don’t yet support SVG P/S."*
